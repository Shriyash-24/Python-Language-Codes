# Encapsulation -
# You are driving car, and need to apply brake.. applying brake is abstraction from the user.. you don't need to know what happens internally.
# Encapsulation is done to hide the implementation details from the user.

# While using len, it returns length of the given data-type. You don't know how it is implemented.
